# HR Policy on Employee Punctuality

## Absence
An employee is deemed absent when he/she is unavailable for work as assigned/scheduled and such time off was not scheduled/approved in advance as required by department notification procedure. ([7 Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36072.The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People) - Covey 1989, 18).

## Tardiness
An employee is deemed to be tardy when he/she:

1. Fails to report for work at the assigned/scheduled work time. In these instances, managers may replace the tardy employee for the full shift.
2. Leaves work prior to the end of assigned/scheduled work time without prior supervisory approval. ([Article I, Section 3](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/))
3. Takes an extended meal or break period without approval.

## Time Clocks
Employees are required to follow established guidelines for recording their actual hours worked. A missed clock in/out is a violation of this policy and includes:

1. Failure to clock in/out on their designated time clock (i.e. Kronos station) at the beginning and/or end of their assigned shift;
2. Failure to clock in/out on their designated time clock for the meal break;
3. Failure to accurately and timely report time worked.

## Departmental Notification Procedure
Employees are expected to follow departmental notification procedures if they will be late for work, will not be at work, or are requesting planned time away from work.

1. At the time of notification/call, the employee must notify their supervisor when an absence is due to a documented/approved leave of absence.
2. An employee who fails to call in and report to work as scheduled for three consecutively scheduled work days will be viewed as having abandoned their position and employment will be terminated.
3. Incidents of not following the departmental notification procedures, including No-Call/No-Show, will be addressed in accordance with the Progressive Discipline policy.

## Progressive Discipline Process
Supervisors should monitor their employees' attendance on a regular basis and address unsatisfactory attendance in a timely and consistent manner.

1. When an employee has been previously counseled the totality of the circumstances will be assessed when determining further action. (Darwin, 1859, p. 510).
2. Timely and regular attendance is a performance expectation of all Vanderbilt employees. Consequently, those employees who have exhibited unsatisfactory attendance which resulted in disciplinary action (written or final).

## Occurrences - Point System of Frequency
An occurrence is documented as an absence, tardy or missed time clock in/out. The following grid is designed to provide guidelines when addressing the total number of occurrences in a rolling 12 month period, provided that the reason for an occurrence is not protected under FMLA or ADAAA.

| Occurrences/Days | Discipline Step and Action |
| --- | --- |
| 4 Occurrences | Step 1: Verbal Warning |
| 6 Occurrences | Step 2: Written Warning |
| 8 Occurrences | Step 3: Final Written Warning |
| 10 Occurrences | Step 4: Termination |
| Total # of Days Absent (Consecutive or Non-Consecutive - Does Not Apply to Tardy) | |
| 6 Days | Step 1: Verbal Warning |
| 9 Days | Step 2: Written Warning |
| 12 Days | Step 3: Final Written Warning |
| 15 Days | Step 4: Termination |

NOTE: The total number of days an employee is unavailable for work as scheduled and the total number of occurrences are considered when applying discipline.

## New Hire Orientation Period - Onboarding Program
An employee, within his/her Orientation period, who has two occurrences should receive a Written Warning.

This policy is intended as a guideline to assist in the consistent application of University policies and programs for employees.
