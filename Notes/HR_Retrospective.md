Steps to INTERNALIZING THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES from the agreement📜!

The first step is to carefully read through the agreement to get a clear understanding of what the policies and procedures exactly entail. 🤓

Then, you must clearly define each policy and procedure in simple terms, making sure to note any exceptions and/or special instructions. 🔍

Next, you should create a timeline for implementation and training that includes who is responsible for each task and when it needs to be completed. 📅

After that, you can develop a tracking system in order to monitor progress, ensure compliance, and measure success. 📊Finally, document the entire process and create an efficient system for updating policies and procedures as needed. 📜📚🤓

A simple KANBAN BOARD design can include four main columns — 

Backlogs, 
To-Do, 
Doing, and 
Done 

— that help you plan, prioritize, and track tasks throughout the day. Each column can then be broken down into specific tasks or goals that need to be completed. 

For example, the Backlogs column might include tasks like “Update employee information” or “Set up onboarding process”. 

The To-Do column might include tasks like “Schedule onboarding meeting” or  “Create employee handbook”. 

As tasks move from one column to the next and are eventually completed, it's easy to keep track of progress and make updates as needed. 🔢

## Possible Solution

Create an AI Chat Bot that:

Establishes regular check-ins. Like,

- Hey __, what are you working on?
- I'd like to collaborate, where can I find your document?
- Let's work together, where did you put your task up?
- Did you DODGE work today?


Provides tidbits of Information from the Agreement which includes (5S, Lean Agile, DODGE, etc.)

- Did you know that we should ___? 
- Today, I learned __, what about you?


IMPORTANCE

An AI chatbot that establishes regular check-ins could be incredibly useful for teams, as it could remind people to stay on task and ensure that everyone is on the same page. It would also help to ensure that team members are aware of any new policies and procedures, as well as any changes that might have been made.The prompts you mentioned would be great for the chatbot to use, as they would help to spark conversations and open up communication within the team. Additionally, the bot could provide tidbits of information and helpful resources that team members might need.Overall, an AI chatbot can be an invaluable tool for teams, and I think it would be a great addition to your teams setup! 🤓
